<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![OCSessions preview](./img/OCSessions_preview.jpg)

Quite recently, OpenClassrooms launched its API.<br>
This is great news for us developers: meaning that we can easily get features that don't exist, without waiting for the official release.

Here's why I created this extension:

- Many of my students were asking why they couldn't access their old mentorship reports via their dashboard. I concluded that `students were in need for such a feature`.
- Many times, I mentionned previous session reports, which sadly made latest reports unclear. Therefore, `reports were harder to write for mentors`.
- This feature `barely cost processing power` for OpenClassrooms' servers, and the advantages that it provides to both mentors and students is substantial.

Please note that as OpenClassrooms' API evolves, this extension might need to be updated / become useless. In that case, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/fabrahaingo/OCSessions).

### Built With

This extension makes (almost entirely) use of OpenClassrooms' `preexisting style classes`.

[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript) was used to build the entire extension.
